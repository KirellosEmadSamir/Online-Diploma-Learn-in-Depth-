Explanation :
The commented numbers in the above program denotes the steps number below :

Create one integer variable count to store the count of 1. Create one more integer variable number to store the value of user input value.
Ask the user to enter the number and store it in variable number.
Start one while loop. The loop will run till the value of number becomes 0.
Do bitwise & of number and number - 1 and set the value to number. Increment the value of count. Do the same process again and again till number becomes 0.
After the loop is completed, print the value of count i.e. total number of 1 in binary representation of number.
Sample Output :
Enter a number :
4
Total number of 1 is = 1

Enter a number :
5
Total number of 1 is = 2

Enter a number :
7
Total number of 1 is = 3
